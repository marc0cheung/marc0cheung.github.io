> Colaboratory is a Google research project designed to help disseminate machine learning training and research results. It is a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud.
>
> Colaboratory notebooks are stored on Google Cloud drives and can be shared, just as you would with Google Docs or Forms. colaboratory is free to use.
>
> With Colaboratory, it is easy to develop deep learning applications using frameworks such as Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV and more. 



As we all know, GPUs are an important hardware need for deep learning development, and Google Colab amounts to giving us a powerful, easy to use and most importantly **free** GPU resource!

This tutorial will focus on the use and operation at the Google Colab level, see [Training your own YOLOv4 weights](https://marc0cheung.github.io/doc/2022/06/train-yolov4-weights/) for more information on preparing files for YOLOv4 training.
