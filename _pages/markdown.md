**Good News!** 

I made a gitbook (which is currently in Simplified Chinese only, zhHK ver. and English ver. will be published as soon as possible) called "[YOLOv4 From Zero to Hero](https://marco-cheung.gitbook.io/yolov4-from-zero-to-hero-simplified-cn/)". Mainly concern on the steps about how to apply YOLOv4 rapidly. Go check it out.
