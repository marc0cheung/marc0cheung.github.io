# [ImageCap](https://github.com/marc0cheung/ImageCap)

ImageCap is a Python Software for rapid image capture for neural network training. Support ratio-protected image resize and image rotate. GUI designed and generated by PySide2 (PyQt5). 



# [YOLOv4 Detector with OpenCV::dnn](https://github.com/marc0cheung/YOLOv4_Detection_dnnOpenCV)

YOLOv4-Tiny Remote Control Detection instances using OpenCV DNN module. 3 versions of code are available: Pure C++ / C++ with Qt 5.15.0 / Python with PySide2. 



The YOLO family of deep learning networks has been well received by the community. [AlexeyAB](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/) uses Darknet to implement YOLOv4, a target detection network with a good balance of speed and recognition rate. The OpenCV support for the DNN module makes it easy to read the neural network weights, `.cfg` files and `.names` files, thus eliminating the slow detection rate of Darknet.
