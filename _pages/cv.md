  - The extension of this project, "Research on the key technology of multi-objective flexible grasping of picking robot in the non-structural environment", was funded by Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Innovation Strategy Special Fund ("Climbing Plan" Special Fund).
  - Obtained patent "A fruit picking sequence planning method based on visual selective attention mechanism", Patent Publication No. CN 112136505A
- **STM32-based Multi-functional Steering Wheel for Agricultural Machinery** (Jun 2019 - Dec 2020)
  - Project leader, responsible for managing all aspects of the development team and monitoring the development progress.
  - Responsible for the development of the main control system, writing and debugging microcontroller programs, developing algorithms for receiving and decoding the satellite positioning data, etc.
  - Participation in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for University Students - Innovation Training Program, and was awarded the provincial-level project of Guangdong Province under the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for University Students.
  - Obtained software copyright "A Software System for Intelligent Steering Wheels of Farming Machine (ISWOS)", software copyright registration No. 2020SR1692317
