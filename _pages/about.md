Hi, I'm Marco Cheung and I'm currently studying for a Master's degree in Electronic Information Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. This site contains some nice little projects I've worked on during my undergraduate study, my internships, as well as during my masters. Please feel free to visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/marc0cheung/) to check them out or set them up. Feel free to raise issues and PRs to help improve my projects. 

Some of the blog posts contain some of my Computer Science/EIE learning tips and thoughts. If there are errors or omissions in them, please feel free to contact me by email. I am also considering whether there is an appropriate way to communicate with each other in a way that avoids harassment and protects the privacy of both parties.
